If you are not using the Resources plugin (and, seriously, you should be), then the @<jqts:resources>@ tag is used to include the required JavaScript resources in an application. This tag can be placed in a Sitemesh layout file (e.g. @main.gsp@) or in individual GSP files. 

{code}
<jqts:resources/>
{code}

If the application is running in development mode, a non-minified version of the required JavaScript resources will be included. If not in development mode, a minified version is included.
